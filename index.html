                <p>Hello my name is Chetan Munegowda, am from Bangalore. I visited Chennai embassy for my H1B visa appointment</p>
                <p>I finished my visa interview on April 10th 2018. Interview went good, answered all questions precisely up to the point. 
                  But I had not carried few documents which interviewer asked me - my project description letter and company tax documents. So I was given 
                  221g blue form for adminitrative processing and was told to wait till they request me to submit my passport.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I had no clue during interview what was this about. Later came home, did all research, got information about adminisrative processing, it might take upto
                  60 days to resolve. Considering, my current situation, I knew it was going to be tough to wait for 2 months doing nothing, it really scared me. My return flight
                  tickets were booked on April 28th 2018.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My Employer submitted documents after 15 days of my visa interview, on 24th April 2018. Once documents were submitted, I was relieved, went to Chennai 
                  consulate to submit my passport, but they refused to take the passport without document proof. As I mentioned before, I was not aware of this process, learnt it the hard way. 
                  I cancelled my flight ticket for 28th April later.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I had full support from my employer and my parents. It was rough finiancially since I was on unpaid leave after three weeks of my vacation. I spent time visiting temples, watching movies, visting friends, 
                  reading books, attended few family functions and went on few temple trips. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  I got email to submit my passport on June 13th 2018, next day I visited Chennai Emabassy to submit my passport hoping the process will be faster, so I don't have to wait more.
                  Later, in two weeks I had two updates on my case but status was still shown as administrative processing, some relief I had that they are still working on my case. 
                  But on June 28th, my passport status got updated to Issued, this releived all my worries, glad they decided to take some decision.
